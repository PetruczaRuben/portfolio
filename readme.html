<h1>The Foodie API project</h1>
<p>
  This particular project has a special place in my heart, because this was my
  first real-world pure javascript project
</p>
<hr />
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  The Foodie app is a free to use seemingly simple web-application, but with
  advanced features.
  <br />
  Users can search for any dish/ingredient, and view the search resutls. You as
  an user also have the ability to upload your own recipe, add and delete
  recipes from your 'bookmarks', both of these are stored in local storage, so
  you can come back later and still see said recipes. The UX was enhanced by
  implementing pagination, so only a limited amount of search result will show
  up at first, not overcrowding the view height.
  <br />
  Foodie utilizes a great third-party api called Forkify-api/v2, and the core
  file architecture is based on the so-called MVC model.

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>
  MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to
  implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a
  separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation
  of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.
